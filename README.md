# Gyro-Drift-Dataset
A static gyro drift dataset of a static silicon micro-gyroscope and accelerometer

This dataset contains z-axis angular velocity and three covariates————white Gaussian noise, time, z-axis acceleration.

Notice that the second white Gaussian noise is generated by the function 'randn' in Matlab according to corresponding variance, you can just ignore it or generate a new noise serie if you like.

This dataset has been used in my paper(not proposed yet)  proposing a LSTM-based RNN named DeepARMA which combines ARIMA with an existing time series forecasing network DeepAR.
